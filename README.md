## Project title: Running from Responsibilities
This is a 2D runner style game. This is a game where your character is constently running using your jumping abilities to get over, under, and inbetween obstacles.The goal is to go the furthest.  

### **Motivation:**

* Running games are great because they are something that is easy to pick up for a minute, and put down. It was a big part of my college experince weirdly enough. My sophmore year is when temple run and flappy bird started to get super popular. This became a little competition between my group of friends. I'm aware you can find the apk for flappy bird anywhere, but I still have it on a microSD from my old android. Runner style games have a place in my heart, and it'd be a great experince to attempt my own. 

### **Must be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player):**

* My answer to this would be to have the CPU chase your character. Similar to TempleRun,  It would have a delayed start and when you hit certain obstacles it would slow you down, allowing the CPU to catch up. The other option is a ghost mode, where your best run plays alongside you, kind of like a time trial.


### **A win state - a way for the player to win the game**

* The ideal "win-state" for this type of game would be a high-score, whether it's by distance traveled, obstacles passed,or "coins" collected. 


### **A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game**

* There would be more than one way to lose, for example, hitting too many obstacles allowing the CPU to get you  would be a "Game Over". Another would be falling off the stage, maybe you didn't make the complete jump and landed inbetween platforms. Another would be hitting a dangerous obstacle, such as a spikes on the ground. 


### **A way to keep playing if the game is not over**

* The game style in itself is  1 life style game, so when you died it would bring you back to the beginning asking you to play again. Another idea would to have a simple reset button incase you wanted to do better the next time. 

### **Challanges to address:**

* I am aware that I do now know how collision works currently in Javascript, but I have time and the ability to research. The same goes for having controls based around the keyboard keys instead of just the mouse.
